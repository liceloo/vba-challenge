Module 2 Challenge

## Background
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

*The ticker symbol

*Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

*The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
